# cache2k 1.3.2.Alpha

This is a preview release for evaluation purposes and should not be used in production.

## New and Noteworthy

- Synchronous execution of expiry listener

## Possible Breakages

`Cache2kBuilder.addListener` will execute an `EntryExpiredLister` synchronously. In version
1.2 an expiry listener was always executed synchronously. This is an potentially incompatible 
change, in case expiry listeners are uses. Review the existing client code and
make sure that addAsyncListeners is used for an `EntryExpiredLister`.

## API Changes 

None

## Fixes and Improvements

- fix missing expiry listener call after a created listener call, in case expiry during the insert
- `expiry`, `expireAfterWrite`, `refresAhead`: Fix race condition of a `Cache.put` and the
  termination of the probation period after a refresh.
